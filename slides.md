# An Introduction to Introductions

## Setting the workshop environment

Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like.

How did those courses start on the first day? Were you confident in the
instructors ability to teach the course? Did you feel like the instructor was
enthusiastic about the course and invested in the students outcomes? Was it clear
what you were going to be learning? Were you excited to get the chance
to be learning about those things? Or did you leave that first day thinking
the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the students they wanted to
be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?

## Why is the environment important


- In Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry we're teaching not only a set of skills,
but at least as importantly we're trying to give learners the confidence to use
these tools and learn more on their own.

- Can help reduce stereotype threat

- Helps the instructor get started and be less nervous

### Goals for the introduction

After the introduction

Students should:
- believe in your competence to teach the workshop
- be able to predict the type of instruction
- know what the learning objectives are (what will be taught)
- know what will be required of them

The instructor should:
- have an understanding of who is taking the workshop and what their expectations are

### Components of the introduction

To meet these objectives an introduction should have 8 components

- Orchestrate positive first impressions
- Introduce yourself effectively
- Clarify learning objectives and expectations
- Help students learn about each other
- Set the tone for the workshop
- Collect baseline data on students' knowledge and motivation
- Whet students' appetite for workshop content
- Inform students of workshop requirements

### Introducing yourself effectively

**What characteristics do you want to convey about yourself?**  

**What will you need to say to convey those characteristics?**  

**Why are you teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop?**  

**What should you be careful not to say?**

### Exercise

Get in a group of three with two other people you haven't met before.

Each person do a video introducing themselves and get feedback from the
other two in the group.
